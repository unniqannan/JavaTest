1. What is the difference between Path and Classpath.  (uses of javac and java)       
- path - used for OS to compile - to tell where is java and to compile the java file
         Provide the java path till bin  
             javac filename.java
-   Classpath -  used by java itself to run the class files.  set till java direc\lib
        java filename
 


2 . AccessModifiers

Private: The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
Default: The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.
Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.
Public: The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.


3. non-access modifiers
static
abstract
native, volatile, transient etc

Static, final declarations

Constructor


Binding
Static binding 
      i. Early binding - object is determind at compile time 
                        overrride will not work here
Dynamic binding	
	i. Early binding - determined at runtime
                  - super class refer the objects to sub class
                  - overrirde is possible

example:
Bank 
   printParent()
   Deposit();

Axis extends
   printChild()

icici extends Bank
    printicichiChild()
    Deposit();


Axis a=new Axis()
a.parent
a.child

icici i=new icicici();
i.printicichild();
i.Deposit();   //static binding

Bank d=new Bank();
d.deposit()
Bank b=new icici();
b.deposit();
